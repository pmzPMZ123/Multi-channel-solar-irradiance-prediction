Code implementation of a multi-channel short-term solar irradiance prediction model（MC-WT-CBiLSTM）：

The program consists of several parts：

1.Data: sample data with three time intervals

2.Main.py:Multi channel GHI prediction program, including multiple multi-channel model code implementation

3.Evalaute_data:Include various evaluation index functions for evaluating model performance

4.NewSWT.py:Wavelet transform support function packet.

5.ScatterPlot.py：Drawing procedure of rectangular coordinate distribution diagram including prediction results

Operating environment:

Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

Keras:2.3.1

Tensorflow:1.15.0

Sklearn：0.21.3

Python：3.6

Pyhht：0.1.0
Main.py contains a variety of models. The machine learning comparison model code has not been uploaded, and other deep learning comparison models can be changed slightly in main
